# Lending Club Dataset

### Introduction

The aim of this project is to use the Lending Club data to build machine learning models for loan grant, grade, subgrade and interest rate prediction.
Final models are then deployed to Google Cloud Platform as APIs.

### Technologies

- Typical data science tools - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, but also `duckdb` for querying large pandas dataframes in memory.
- Gradient boosting frameworks - `XGBoost` and `LightGBM`.
- Dimensionality reduction - `umap`.
- Feature selection - `shap` and `shaphypetune`.
- Hyperparameter tuning - `optuna`.
- API creation and deployment - `Flask`, `Docker` and `Google Cloud Platform`.
